            <p>Intric is a detachable clothing company created in late 2022 and based in Indonesia. it focuses on making
                simple but intricately designed functional clothing in the form of a shirt with detachable parts. Intric
                aims to create clothing that is flexible towards the customer's taste by allowing customisation to the
                detachable areas. The concept has been around for quite some time, but Intric is the first one to do it
                here in Indonesia. Quite cool right?</p>
